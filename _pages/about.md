I am a PhD candidate studying Social Psychology with a concentration in Quantitative Methods at Temple University in Philadelphia, PA (expected graduation: May 2025). I have experience working as a quantitative researcher in both academic and industry settings. My academic research primarily examines how people best provide one another social support within different situations and across various relationships. I utilize naturalistic experimental and quasi-experimental designs to test these questions using linguistic, behavioral, physiological, and survey/self-report data. I am passionate about both leveraging data and reviewing prior scientific findings to tell meaningful stories with real-world applicability. I hold an MA in Psychology from Temple University and a BS from Tufts University, where I majored in Psychology, Spanish, and International Relations.
