I am a Research Analyst at the Wharton AI and Analytics Initiative within The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. I am passionate about leveraging data to uncover meaningful insights. 

I completed my Ph.D. in Psychology with a concentration in Quantitative Methods at Temple University in Philadelphia, PA in the Social and Affective Neuroscience Laboratory (PI: Chelsea Helion, PhD). I hold an M.A. in Psychology from Temple University and a B.S. with majors in Psychology, Spanish, and International Relations from Tufts University.
