Hi! I’m Ginny, and I am a quantitative-focused, mixed-methods researcher excited about uncovering meaningful insights from complex data in a variety of domains. I have nearly a decade of experience working on interdisciplinary research projects from their earliest stages (analysis planning, experimental and survey design) through completion (data visualization, synthesis, and communication of findings), and have worked in academic and corporate settings. 

I hold a PhD in Psychology with a concentration in Quantitative Methods from Temple University, where my academic research explored how everyday forms of social connection are associated with emotional wellbeing and ways that social cognition can relate to pursuit of personal and shared goals. I also hold a B.S. from Tufts University, where I majored in Psychology, Spanish, and International Relations.
