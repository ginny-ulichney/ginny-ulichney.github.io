I am a PhD candidate in Psychology with a concentration in Quantitative Methods in the Social and Affective Neuroscience Laboratory (PI: Chelsea Helion, PhD) at Temple University in Philadelphia, PA. My academic research primarily examines how people best provide one another social support to advance toward their goals within different situations and across various relationships. I utilize naturalistic experimental and quasi-experimental designs to test these questions with linguistic, behavioral, physiological, and survey/self-report data. I am passionate about leveraging data to tell meaningful stories. 

I hold an M.A. in Psychology from Temple University and a B.S. in Psychology, Spanish, and International Relations from Tufts University.
