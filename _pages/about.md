About me
======
I am a PhD Candidate studying Social Psychology with a concentration in Quantitative Methods in the Social and Affective Neuroscience Lab (Advisor: Dr. Chelsea Helion) at Temple University. I am broadly interested in leveraging quantitative methods to understand how people 1) best support one another, 2) form expectations about their own and others' prosocial behavior, 3) best pursue their goals, and 4) ehnance one anothers' well-being. I have experience approaching these questions using naturalistic experimental and quasi-experimental designs to collect behavioral, physiological, self-report, and survey data. I also apply a broad range of frequentist and Bayesian statistical models to analyze these data.
